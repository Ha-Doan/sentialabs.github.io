**Locksmith allows you to easily switch between accounts in the AWS portal!**

Are you managing many different Amazon Web Services accounts? Locksmith is a
Chrome extension that allows you to easily switch between accounts! It provides
a dropdown menu from which you can select one of your accounts, and it will open
a new Chrome window with a session to the web console of that account.

The extension uses IAMs Cross-Account Roles, therefore you only need credentials
for one AWS account. This also means that you only need a single MFA (virtual)
token, no matter how many accounts you manage!
